Use an editor of your choice to write a short program that does the following:

1) opens a file named input.txt with a line of two numbers in the format:

1000;-3

where both numbers are integers, the first positive and the second negative

2) assigns those two values to the variables:  total_count and step_size, respectively

3) loops from total_count to 0 by step_size, printing the loop integer for each step


Your program can be written in any computer language you feel comfortable with.

It doesn't have to actually run, but it should have a reasonable change of running.


Upload your program as an attachment.
