Week 1  9/1 - 9/5
=================

Day 1: Wednesday, September 3
-----------------------------

* Learning objectives: get comfortable with simple functions
  and plotting in python
* Assignment: get computer lab account and password ($25) from main office front desk
* Assignment: Due Thursday:  Week 1: Programming Problem on Connect:  `week1.txt <week1.txt>`_
* Reading for Friday:  Install anaconda python and work through as much of `Python crash course`_
  and `Introduction to Python programming`_  as you can in 3 hours

Day 2: Friday, September 5
--------------------------

* My answer for the Wednesday assignment `week1.ipynb <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/a301-teaching/classcode/blob/35475c23aec925399ead0a77d8797c44f102c89e/notebooks/week1.ipynb>`_

Assignment for Day 3: Monday Sept. 8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
* Assignment for Monday -- before Monday 10 am upload an IPython notebook to Connect that does as much as you can of the following tasks:

  * Use the examples in `Johansson Lecture 1 <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-Python-Programming.ipynb>`_  to define a function to calculate `Stull 2.6 <text/stull_chap2_eqn2_6.pdf>`_  to find :math:`\Psi`, the local elevation angle in degrees

  * Evaluate your function for the hours between 3 and 21 and show that the elevation angle agrees with the solved example
    for Vancouver, BC on 22 Dec, 23 Mar. and 22 Jun   (don't have to make a plot, just printing the numbers is ok

Week 2  9/8 - 9/12
==================

* Week 2: Learning objectives

  * Learning goals: Introduce wavenumber, field of view, radiance and irradiance,
    blackbody radiation, Stefan-Boltzman, Wien's Law, equilibrium temperature, Kirchoff's law


Day 4: Monday Sept. 8
---------------------

* Go over the `elevation notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/a301-teaching/classcode/blob/master/notebooks/day3_elevation.ipynb>`_

* Do the "white paper" exercise

* Assignment for Wednesday:  Read Stull pp. 34-38 on flux and blackbody radiation and
  Wallace and Hobbs pp. 113-118 on radiation and complete the `Stefan-Boltzman notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/a301-teaching/classcode/blob/master/notebooks/stefan_boltzman.ipynb>`_

Day 4: Wednesday Sept. 10
-------------------------

* finish white paper example

* go over `the stefan-boltzman answer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/a301-teaching/classcode/blob/master/notebooks/stefan_boltzman_answer.ipynb>`_

* work with the `planck function library <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/a301-teaching/classcode/blob/master/notebooks/plotplanck.ipynb>`_

* Assignment for Friday:  Read my `Notes on geometry and planck function`_
  and complete `the derivitives notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/a301-teaching/classcode/blob/master/notebooks/derivatives.ipynb>`_
  
Day 5: Friday Sept. 12
----------------------

* Go over the `Notes on geometry and planck function`_ handout

* Review `derivitives solution <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/a301-teaching/classcode/blob/master/notebooks/wiens_law.ipynb>`_

* For Monday, read W&H 116 to 122 and my `Notes on radiative equilibrium`_

* Finish and upload my `Wien's law for wavenumber notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/a301-teaching/classcode/blob/master/notebooks/wiens_law_wavenumber.ipynb>`_
