Assignment for Day 3: Monday Sept. 8
====================================
  
* Assignment for Monday -- before Monday 10 am upload an IPython notebook to Connect that does as much as you can of the following tasks:

  * Use the examples in `Johansson Lecture 1 <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-Python-Programming.ipynb>`_  to define a function to calculate `Stull 2.6 <text/stull_chap2_eqn2_6.pdf>`_  to find :math:`\Psi`, the local elevation angle in degrees

  * Evaluate your function for the hours between 3 and 21 and show that the elevation angle agrees with the solved example
    for Vancouver, BC on 22 Dec, 23 Mar. and 22 Jun   (don't have to make a plot, just printing the numbers is ok
